# homework1
This is a homework project where I organize, re-write and consolidate code under semantic elements. Styling is consolidated and re-applied to new semantic elements of the index html.

I've added comments and written alternative text for image elements, icons and the header figure. This was a modification of a pre-existing web page, also known as "refactoring". 

Styling of html elements were consolidated to apply to sub-elements within the primary elements demonstrating how CSS can be optimized.
